# JPMC -Android Coding Challenge: NYC SChools:

The app requirements are rather high-level and vague. If details are omitted, it is because we will be happy with any of a wide variety of solutions. Feel free to be creative and impress with code and UX (see more details down).
You are allowed to use all the online resources you can find and use any 3rd party library if desired. Remember to make it usefull for an actual user/student.

# Instructions:

Create a native app (no react-native and or flutter) to provide information on NYC High Schools.

1. Display a list of NYC High Schools.
  * Get your data here: [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/DOE-High-School-Directory-2017/s3k6-pzi2](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/s3k6-pzi2)
2. Selecting a school should show additional information about the school.
  * Display all the SAT scores - include Math, Reading and Writing.
  * SAT data here: [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/f9bf-2cp4)
